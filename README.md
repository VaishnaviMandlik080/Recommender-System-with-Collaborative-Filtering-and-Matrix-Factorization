#  Recommender System with Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on building a recommender system that predicts user preferences based on their historical interactions. Using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization, the model generates personalized suggestions for users similar to them.

##  Features
- User-Item interaction data analysis  
- Collaborative filtering using user-based and item-based similarity  
- Matrix factorization with techniques like SVD  
- Evaluation using RMSE and MAE  
- Visualization of recommendation accuracy and trends  

##  Techniques Used
- **Collaborative Filtering** â€“ Based on user-user and item-item similarity  
- **Matrix Factorization** â€“ Decomposes the rating matrix using SVD  
- **Evaluation Metrics** â€“ RMSE, MAE  

##  Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** â€“ Data manipulation  
- **Scikit-learn, Surprise** â€“ Recommendation modeling  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Used a user-item rating dataset such as the **MovieLens dataset** for training and evaluation.

##  Workflow
1. Load and preprocess the dataset  
2. Build similarity matrices for users and items  
3. Apply collaborative filtering and matrix factorization  
4. Generate top-N recommendations for each user  
5. Evaluate model performance  

##  Evaluation
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
